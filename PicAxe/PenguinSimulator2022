I have made up FOUR identical circuit boards, one for everyone :)
These simulate a mini IoT setup as used by modern penguins at Port Taranaki:
- Two live temperatures (2 x DS18B20 on board) Ch 1 and Ch 2
- Semi rendom RFID Ch 3

The project view is Live at present on one of these boards in Opunake:

You do Not need to worry about this bit but it gives you some idea why
using picaxe basic is so easy and so much fun as the relatively high
level commands virtually talk direct to the hardware with Meaningful
names that sound like what they do !

The complete bas code must be Very powerful as it usually alerts every
security widget and scam.  I can send you a .txt version if you want
this for full deal :)

For those of you with too much spare time here are the key lines of code
that make it tick:

do

Temperature:
  readtemp12 1,w1       'Read pin1 DS18B20 12 bit temperature > w1
  w1 = w1 * 10 / 16     'Convert 12 bit > Decimal Deg C
  w0 = w1               'Transfer data word to Tx Routine Variable     
  b9 = 1                        'Set the Channel number
  gosub Tx_Pi_Data      'Tx the Data direct to Pi via jumper leads

RFID:                   'On a semi regular basis
  random w3
  w0 = w3               'Transfer data word to Tx Routine Variable     
  b9 = 3                        'Set the Channel number
  gosub Tx_Pi_Data      'Tx the Data direct to Pi via jumper leads

Bat_Voltage:            'Every so often check and send battery voltage
  gosub mVcc            'Read picaxe internal voltage refference
  w0 = w12              'Transfer data word to Tx Routine Variable     
  b9 = 3                        'Set the Channel number
  gosub Tx_Pi_Data      'Tx the Data direct to Pi via jumper leads

loop

Tx_Pi_Data:             'Build the Virtual_Cicadacom_Packet
  b8 = "1"              'Cicadacom Gateway Node Number
  b9 = b9               'Channel Number
  w6 = b8 + b9 + w0     'Generate a crude Check-SUM
  serout 4,T2400,(":0",44,b8,44,#b9,44,#w0,44,#w6,13,10)
  return

e.g.  :01,1,123,126 = Channel 1 12.3 Deg C                     
e.g.  :01,2,222,225 = Channel 2 22.2 Deg C
e.g.  :01,3,11111,11115 = Channel 3 RFID 11111
e.g.  :01,4,5100,5105 = Channel 4 5100 mVolts Battery
