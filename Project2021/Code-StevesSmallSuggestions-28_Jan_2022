* TOML use and Penguin detection by Kit ...
* Based on work started by Steve Cosgrove in 2019
* Code and documentation available from ...

Put the initialization stuff into functions
* Call this to get started
* Record TOML date/time
* Each time the main loop loops, check current date/time
   * If it has changed, re-read the file
