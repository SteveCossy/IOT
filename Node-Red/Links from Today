Example of an existing open source project that has some ideas for us.

Process control software Andrew mentioned.

My mycodo server demonstrates what we are aiming at, but not very reliable!  Currently not working, but should be in a week or two.

I have created a video capture showing my software drawing pins on a map.  Can't think of a conservation purpose for this, but it looks interesting.

This is the map I showed you that reads GIS data from a .csv file on a server at Whitireia and displays it on a map.  All the Python and Java source is in my GitHub repository.

Hi Steve

Any chance you could find this config file for me? Or other config files containing mqtt client ID? so I can test it in node-red.

~/cayenneMQTT.txt

Thanks!

Regards
LJ

 11 # the IOT/LoRaReAd dir contains MQTTUtils.py
 12 MQTTUpath =     os.path.join(HomeDir,'IOT/LoRaReAd')
 13 sys.path.append(MQTTUpath)
 14 from MQTTUtils import Save2CSV

 17 LocPath =       os.path.join(HomeDir,'CayMQTT')
 18 CSVPath =       os.path.join(HomeDir,'CSVfiles')
 19 CSV =           '.csv'
 20 CrLf =          '\r\n'
 21 GeoFile =       'RSSILatLong'

 23 ConfPathFile =  HomeDir+ConfFile
 24
 25 # Cayenne authentication info. This should be obtained from the Cayenne Dashboard,
 26 #  and the details should be put into the file listed above.

 28 # Read the Cayenne configuration stuff into a dictionary
 29 ConfigDict = toml.load(ConfPathFile)
 30 CayenneParam = ConfigDict.get('cayenne')
