Yes

I am still on track to be around Wellington on Tuesday
They have been installing night vision / Ird web cam to the site this
week in between showers. So the project is going to lend itself even
more to remote monitoring, access and or development of some novel IoT
tools.

Do feel free to ask for any information or live links.

A nice little challenge would be to 'fish out' penguin signs of life /
activity from a background ambient thermal environement :)

Other thing I am keen on is connecting this novel tech to the front end
to a TTN V3 dashboard via Pi py
... to create a standard physical Pi ttyAMA0 port connection that
connects a range of creative uW 'Open Sauce Hardware' to TTN

This could cross over into the whole Penguin initiative and significant
work being done in NPL at present.

Connecting Andrew's technology approach to The Things Network would be
a good idea.
In a nutshell, Andrew predominantly uses these chips:
https://picaxe.com/hardware/picaxe-chips/picaxe-08m2-microcontroller/
.. which we want to connect to this cloud:
https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/
https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/quick-start/

Currently modus-operandi is that a board run by a PICAXE has a
whatever transmitter sending serial data to a compatible receiver on a
Raspberry Pi.  The Pi then uses whatever Internet connection it has to
send the data to a cloud provider.

What happens next is a big quandary.  We can chat.

Personally, I like the idea of a getting the PICAXE to do clever
things, then use its one-wire bus to connect to this:
https://www.dragino.com/downloads/downloads/LHT65/UserManual/LHT65_Temperature_Humidity_Sensor_UserManual_v1.7.3.pdf
That would create a low-current (ŒºAmp sleeping) combo that can use the
PICAXE serial to to easily read any serial module and send the data to
the LHT65 which can send it to a standard LoRaWAN gateway.  Dammit -
LHT65 is not open source.

Lots of options.
If you want something to keep your brain going, without having to deal
with licensing or politics etc, lots of things could be done to
improve my IoT infrastructure. https://github.com/SteveCossy/IOT/wiki

Will send an invite for Tuesday!

Yes I am keen to update the way I connect to present IoT via Pi ttyAMA0
to TTN V3.

This would standardize my present working projects, formalize output,
and I hope learn me a heap about TTN.  I have used Cayenne up until now
but know know little about TTN since I can not 'see' any of my work on
line in a dashboard anywhere.  I am Very much a Practical coder.  The
'Cicadacom'  system I use works, has been developed and refined over 10
years.  I would love to see more some formal and recognizable output  in
every sense so I can help share some ideas around.

The interface:
+++++++++
Demarcation for me is a python script handshaking with my projects 7
bytes @2400 baud via the Pi ttyAMA0 serial port into a python script.
Take it away from there any way you like :)

Present approach in brief:
+++++++++++++++++
At present each 7 byte chirrup is checked, unpacked and forwarded to
Cayenne over MQTT Port 1883 with a few lines of python.
I would be grateful if the present system / format  up to the python
unpacking script can be retained.

The system is simple and practical and provides modest reliability with
a Node + Chan + Word + CS
This hits the Pi as ASCII CSV.
It just works.

Looking forward to some back of envelope ideas at a handy cafe Tuesday ?

I see my stuff as hanging in front of a stack.
No way would I expect the Pi to direct connect without politically
correct layers, protocols and various standard shape packets etc
.
I see LoRA is just a  way of connecting bits together (like wire) ?
IF it Has to be  via LoRA'WAN' then  bung in a 10cm / 10m LoRA radio link :)

I read in some recent small print there was a Pi~Stack ?
Surely we should be able to establish some virtual (Cicadacom) device
even as a test case that looks like a LoRAWAN device

Nxt stop would be to feed appropriate data blob into a recognised
compatible virtual LoRA radio (Via a Pi)

Hi Steve, Andrew,

The "whatever" parts are actually quite a big part of the overall equation.

The LHT65 is closed source, and it's onewire bus is probably no suitable
to talk to the picaxe.
There is the LSN50 (
https://www.dragino.com/products/lora-lorawan-end-node/item/155-lsn50-v2.html
<https://www.dragino.com/products/lora-lorawan-end-node/item/155-lsn50-v2.html>
) which is OpenSource, although it's based on STM-Cube which I have a
dislike.

Or you could use an Econode/SmartTrap PCB, which runs opensource, and
made in NZ.
I'm happy to release the schematic as open source, but not the PCB
artwork this is similar to how Adafruit etc work.

The Raspberry Pi / Python doesn't really play a part of LoRaWAN. It
requires way to much power to run, expensive and overly complex.
The exception to this is if your doing edge processing.

You could just string your sensors straight off a SmartTrap PCB, put
that would mean writing code in C++ ??

The advantage of the Picaxe is it's robustness, and dead simplicity.

Another interesting thing to look into is using Basic on the Econode, in
theory possible, but haven't tried it yet...
https://www.coridium.us/coridium/shop/software/s01-basic
<https://www.coridium.us/coridium/shop/software/s01-basic>

Another option is to use an Econode as a bridge between the Dorji LoRa
radio boards and LoRaWAN/TTN
For that to work you would need to standardize on a packet format, and
let the cloud server do the heavy lifting.

Matt

Thanks for your update.
The recent graduate Andrew and I are meeting tomorrow, Lei Ju <rick.jv@gmail.com>, has excellent programming skills, matched with time and enthusiasm!

Is it OK give some a few of the Gen3 (or whatever) boards that you gave me last year?  I'm sure he could manage the software side of things, and learn how your architecture works.  If his enthusiasm turns into actual results, he might be able to contribute to your development work.

This sounds closest so far to what I am after.
The present system is real simple.  It works just fine and interfaces
the picaxe data via Pi as it MQTT posts to Cayenne (or wherever).

Cicadacom has worked for 10 years just fine.  This Very 'Basic' system,
per student / per sensor, one 90 pence 8 pin chip a sensor of choice, a 
battery and a data link into a single Pi ( ~ $25).  The Pi is nearly
always sitting permanently powered in some farm house, shed, classroom,
penguin cafe etc.
The Pi listens to what is going on and passes data up and down to picaxe
devices and projects.  The Pi is a fantastic, well resourced classroom
tool and bit of IT learning kit for all ages.

Per block diagram, the picaxe is deceptively simple looking device.  As
an industrial PIC can interface almost anything around.1w and I2c etc. 
Most of the time the sensor or concept direct connects to the PIC pin
with a wire jumper + One line of bas.  It is flexible and low cost.  Max
creative options and teacher chooses what way they want to go from
component level, electronics theory ABC, semiconductor physics up to
copy and paste the word template library examples direct onto
breadboards or the free industrial grade Kiwipatch / Keapatch PCB's that
fit standard IP enclosures.  The idea is a hands on, practical learning
experience: watching code bring hardware to life creatively at the
lowest level possible.     
https://technology.tki.org.nz/Technology-in-the-NZC/Digital-technologies-support/Strengthening-digital-technologies/Learning-with-the-internet-of-things

Single or multiple devices / projects interface with 7 byte chirrups
into the Pi ttyAMA0 @ 2400 baud serial  using ASK, LoRaLAN, Ird, wire.
At present the Pi can bring real time sensor data into Scratch,
Minecraft, or clunky Blockly etc

Ignoring the above...
+++++++++++++
Suggest it would be great if I can bring this up to date and blend it
somehow into the TTN experience ?  Thru the Pi some how ?
Some thing or some method that can connect the above general idea
streaming data or stack (heap) of variables out of the guts of the Pi in
an agreed format and thru to a TTN dashboard.    If the Pi can be the
basis of some "...bridge between the Dorji LoRa radio boards and
LoRaWAN/TTN" then I am sure we can standardize on a packet formats etc.

Keen to just explore some possibilities and find the limits if any
etc

If we want to keep the Pi unit and only need a long-range communication solution to replace I2C between Picaxe and pi, how about an Arduino plus a Lora transceiver (sx1278).

Pi  <---->  Arduino Uno/Sx1278 Alice <-----lora tx/rx-----> Arduino Uno/Sx1278 Bob <----I2C/GPIO--> Picaxe

We can use Lora only for tx/rx packet without a full loraWan stack. f there is a full LoraWan stack available for Arduino, we can use Arduino as Lora gateway. And the Arduino can do all the work of Pi when we can not find a shred with Wifi hostspot for the Pi unit.

This is along the lines of my thinking as I have use Bare LoRa modules
from various suppliers, several makes over last 5 years.  At present
have settled on Dorji derial interfaced devices.  Note they interface
almost pin for pin at the Pi GPIO ttyAMA0 end :)  I have mad my own
virtual LoRa'LAN' and have plenty of practical field trials to prove the
concept is there ripe for the picking.   The 7 bytes bare Cicadacom
packet is an extreme lite approach and works in practise. (photos)

Serial is easy to trial, test and break out on breadboards and any
terminal program / debug
For practical edu demo and fault finding being able to see bytes, test
and debug ideas it pays to have something super simple you can loop back etc

Some questions to understand the big picture.

1. What are the goals? What/why to improve with the current solution?

2. Why TTN v3? What we need is a long-range tx/rx? or loraWAN for Internet access without wifi AP? or an application cloud server for visualization/data storage? We are going to keep the cayenne/mydevices.com part?

3. Who are the clients of the project? Government, NGO, or some scientists?

Thanks!

So a heap of ideas...

Sounds to me like Cayenne as a clearing house / main broker and some
add on features from existing ideas like Node Red or other similar
free existing bolt ons ?  Then invent what needs to be done to add in
a few more ideas.

Main problem I have and ignorance on my part is not even knowing what
can be done already with stuff out there.  I am a fan of using
existing pathways since no need to re-invent the wheel.

Perhaps a bit of a shopping list of kinds of things we all have seen
would be in order ?
Then ID each item as to what can be done how already pathways and ID
what needs to be worked on

This is nice thanks
Main purpose for me at this stag is just to get head around how to
string things together and  get a few flow going.
I have asked on Cayenne also for the getting started steps for likes of
me / beginners  that I will add into the documentation at the single A4
sheet kind of level.
If we can make a story about this then all well and good.

I am  in H Bay at moment but back on Tuesday.
Wed I will build some penguin temperature sensors on a few model streams

My ideas for a Practical function for Penguin detection would go
something like:
Monitor decimal changes in temperature:
- Rolling average the temperature over 6 to 10 minutes
- Sum the absolute area between these two curves (Raw +/- Ave) over 6 to
10 minutes rolling
- Post this as a raw index value back into Cayenne as an input channel
(+ 50) to the same project
(e.g. a dual trend of Ch 11 = Raw data and 61 = processed data

This way we can see how good the co-relation is by trending raw +
'PingWingDetect' values on a plot
This raw value will need to be looked at as to the threshold Bird:Noise
Ratio :)
But suggest one step at a time

Hi All

Here is a screen grab of what bird temperature trends look like.

I have recently completed installation of thermal all probes on all
penguin nesting boxes and would now like to make a start on the bird
monitoring / nest detection project by trying s few ideas out.

Phase 1:
Single mound / 4 nest box channels trial and experiments:
- Bring the 4x channels of data from just 4x nest boxes in this case
from mound 1 into Node Red on Separate local Pi.
- This could be multiple Pi so we can individually tinker and try ideas out
Can I have a txt grab of what goes into the InPut / Inject Node Red blob

Suggested starter filter idea:
Open to suggestions.
Once the data appears on the screen I would like to try this ideas for a
start...
- MQTT into 4 NR inputs
- Each NR input finds a rolling MIN and MAX value over the last ten minutes
- Output = Difference (MAX - MIN) is a streaming variable that
approximates the movement / presence of birds in the box
- Output back to cayenne on channels where OP Ch ID = IP channel + 50
I am unsure what maths, modules / blobs would be available or the best
way to do this ?
Is there is a PID type ( continuous flow over ten minutes ) OR do we
take readings say every minute within the 'last ten minutes' and time
trigger some sort of clunky math > totalise and divide by ten.

What do you think ?

Here are for this live data:

Hi
Per: http://leiju.org:1880/#flow/16700520.ac948b

Thanks for tips on documentation etc
Very slow Progress but I have most parts of Node Red working to test
some very basic ideas out

MANUAL Sending Works:
The MQTT Send node contains the Topic
"v1/6375a470-cff9-11e7-86d0-83752e057225/things/84f584a0-1e28-11eb-8779-7d56e82df461/data/2"
I can inject manually the string >>>> "analog_sensor,null=12.3" into
"MQTT OP back to Cayenne"

Receiving Data Works:
I can subscribe to "pi-3b4f-ch12" etc and strip off the numeric data
from any channel using num = msg.payload.substring(19)
This strips off the 19,20,21 and 22 character bits = the numbers that we
want
Rough and ready ?  But it works

Sending Result number XX.X back to a new channel in Cayenne:
A very messy system I have cobbled together but looks like will work
well enough for now.
( I am just testing by sending back the same data to a different device
in the same account to just for testing )

The message is composite.  I do not know how to combine the fixed txt
part + the data number so have hacked a work around:
I have tacked the first part of the message that is txt onto the end of
the topic and so I can just inject the bare numeric number
onto the end of the Topic like this:
v1/6375a470-cff9-11e7-86d0-83752e057225/things/84f584a0-1e28-11eb-8779-7d56e82df461/data/62,analog_sensor,null=,
XX.X numeric data is simply left as the message that is injected into
the MQTT OP / Send node.
A bit messy but open to any suggestions, examples how to build it up in
a better way.
Yet to see if it works reliably

++++++++++++++++++
Now for the fun math part: Penguin sensing
I will happily pick away at this.  I need to massage the real time data
to detect fluctuations =  thermal activity = bird.
I plan to use Max over last 10 min - MIN over last ten min.
This will give a number that looking at the live plots will be ~ 0.1 for
an empty burrow to almost a 1.5
It is simply an activity variable 0.0 ~ 1.5 Deg C per 10 min
Any creative suggestions using pretty basic maths and standard nodes all
appreciated

Thanks

Hi
I am learning a lot myself at present that was always the intention. New
tricks for this olde dog !
Great if we can all have a tinker and see what clever stuff we can
extract from Node Red.
My own bent, rough ideas an wish list listed down below.
...
..
.

I was surprised and had no idea of the potential for GUI that came with
the Node Red
I think this is a bolt on influxDB ?
Here is a screen shot of the GUI tab
Is this what you are after ?
I will re locate the link to it shortly...

I think we are just kicking ideas around at this stage.

My interest are:
1/. Excuse for getting into Node Red for me is part curiosity so good
excuse for some familiarity on my part.  It looks like it is just
another great edu tool all ready bolted into the Pi in any classroom for
kids and teachers to explore.

2/. Use it to co-lab and graphically model some what-if type wild life
ideas ( as in penguins )
Could it be usefully  applied to water, climate.  Zealandia / Kaiwhara
stream etc
So you can drag 'flows' and come up with 'what if' flows of ideas to
model things ?

3/. Evaluate Node Red as a kind of math co-processor, logic box, switch
board, dBase and GUI  for Cayenne:
- Cayenne is free cheap and cheerful but pretty hopeless at reliable
display and storage of Big or Long term data sets
- Cayenne I have found to be perfectly good basic tool as a universal
MQTT server and front end dashboard
- Node Red could be a much more reliable and powerful processor of data
streams, triggers, messenger,  GUI etc ?
So far so good, there is a hell of a lot more flexibility and horsepower.
It looks good from my initial tinkering.

TRUE : FALSE Penguins...
Zero'ing in on my particular 'bee in my bonnet' about penguins:)
My initial idea and drive still to simply use Node Red in bare bones
math 'co-processor' mode to do a kind of AI on the birds using temperature.
Do we have a Penguin or NO Penguin, Yes:No / True False etc

So far:
Penguin Deg C > Pub to Cayenne MQTT > Node Red MQTT IN > {{{"Detect
thermal activity"}}} > Node Red MQTT Out  >  Cayenne Dashboard

This is very much in development a happy mess in progress but happening
on: http://leiju.org:1880/#flow/cb7180f9.1390b

Latest discovery that just might do 80% of the job is the switch node
can compare new message with last message. 
Looks like could be a shortcut way to separate out a cascade of >=  and
<= to find a time based step by step MAX and MIN
My JSONata skills are no where near being able to do anything much
smarter yet.  Perhaps a logical design approach wold be to FIFO 10 to 20
sets of reading over 10 min and fish out  ASB difference of the MAX
minus MIN and use this as the result.

Feel free anyone to set up a new Tab example if anyone can make
something I could clone...

My stuff is Only the untidy spaghetti in the sand box mess in the first

( A bit like what the 'un' locked down dog did in the sandpit yesterday
morning.... )

The key ideas I am driving at look like being pretty useful way of
placing hardware devices (Incl LoRaWAN)  along side drag and drop and 
plug and patch.
My mess in the corner is just to test / proof of concept some Starter
ideas.  Learning the hard way works if one has the time !

E.g. sorts of ideas from Node Red Forum:
"I have done market research on Low Code / No Code Platforms. If have
seen different list with providers like Mendix, Betty Blocks and
OutSystems. Why is Node Red not considered as being a no code/low code
