This is a nice example of Code Red.
It is so far closest to the kind of blobs that should solve the math
needed to detect a penguin...
Just thought this a good example of how solving various problems uses
almost bits of strings of code you can copy and paste (Export and
Import) almost within trains of thought / forum discussion...

Hi All,

Looks like I missed a lot of things. Just got extremely busy these weeks. I can see in Node Red UI that Andrew has done a lot of coding already.

One thing about NR is how to back up and version tracking its code. 

All NR code is actually in a single file: flows.json.  The whole project can be recreated as long as there is a copy of flows.json 

I just created a github repository: https://github.com/rickju/penguine

The project is private for now since the code contains MQTT account/pwd etc. I have added Steve in access list.

Hopefully we can set up a cronjob for committing code changes every week. 

Regards
LJ

Hi all

Thanks for sorting the house keeping.  Yes I stumbled into the method of
importing and exporting.  This helped a lot in being able to copy and
paste code ideas from the forum etc.  As you can see I have now pretty
well worked out the JSON math and even how to store variables between
msg.  Took a while but seem to have cracked most of that side of
things.  I have a providional activity meter working and this just needs
the math / PID type functions developed and tuned up.

To make this nice to use with Cayenne I need of some help on correctly
building Cayenne json functionality into the json MQTT Out message.
The method I am using at present just pokes a number or number as a
string onto the topic.
This results in a very limited view and functionality of the data within
Cayenne.   To make this work I have to manually Add and Configure each
channel of  data using the the custom device via menus.  Cayenne Can do
this automatically for us.

So the Next step I would like to crack:
Cayenne can automatically accept and auto configure a widget, scale,
units and Icon by simply sending the correct  msg format.
See >>> https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/cayenne-mqtt-api/
This is a big advantage for people who just want to start using Cayenne
and or Node red without having to dive into deep layers of configuration
The device just pops up on a users account dashboard as a providional
pale green icon...
All the user has to do is click '+'  and they are away. 
I think this is a really positive feature so would like to chase it
along a bit for the Node Red case.

My problem is I do not know enough about the nodes and how the /json
mesg is correctly built and to put together in the correct format for
this really neat feature to work.  Here is the Cayenne document / data
format table:
https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/cayenne-mqtt-api/#cayenne-mqtt-api-mqtt-messaging-topics
As you can see there are hundreds of different sensors that can be used
and auto format.
This is great !

v1/username/things/clientID/data/json
There are lots of 'json code' examples but I do not know how this fits
and look specifically inside an MQTT Out Node:
- Fornat ?
- Syntax ?
- Ch (numeric or string ?)
- Numeric Data = Number

 {
      "channel": 1,
      "value": 16.4,
      "type": "temp",
      "unit": "c"
   },

Looks like could even send multi channels out of One MQTT Out node as well ?

Can I have a json example of a temperature output from my math (or
anythin else) inside the MQTT Out JSON node
I am not too familiar yet with json  so I think the only thing I am
missing is correct use of constant and variable syntax
I.e. how to mix the live temperature numeric math result or data digits
with the fixed string text in the outgoing part
This will then AUTO add and configure a new stream of data and set up
the icon in Cayenne.
Super !

I am sure I will stumble on it sooner or later but any help appreciated

Thanks

~ Andrew

Node red is just nodejs and npm. There are many pid modules available out there.

e.g.  https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-pid-controller

We can install it (or any other module we need) on node red dashboard -> Manager Palette --> Palette  -> Install -> input/search "PID"

Hi
Here is latest way of putting the problem I have at the moment:
99% Lack of JSON skills mainly I think
~ A

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Per:
https://community.mydevices.com/t/using-node-red-as-a-local-fallback-server/1623/22

Thanks for the documentation link.  I can see how the JSON works but
think I need a practical example of what it looks like when placed
inside a Node Red function node.   I just need an example of how a
single JSON string payload is formatted and fits INside a Node Red
function block that is connected to a single channel message to an MQTT
Out Node.

I can manually make fixed numeric things things happen by inserting the
numbers in one place and the txt for the payload (units, type, channel)
in several ways now.  I am missing the format and syntax and need to see
how a Variable number ( the value in my case is PID processed sensor
data)  is bought into the function node and then inserted into the JSON
other bits of string and then sent out ready for the the MQTT Out node

Here is a sand box virtual commented screen grab of what I am trying to
do / figure out
I.e. what goes inside the function block.

Thanks
